\sname{Ptahhotep} addresses his king, \sname{Djedkare Isesi} and describes his plight, which is the suffering that comes with \indexed{old age}.\\

This is relevant to why he would want to pass down his wisdom as part of his legacy, and helps serve as an introduction to the rest of the text.\\

1 - the title \textit{imi rA} is usually translated as "overseer" but is a pun around the \textit{r} glyph having the shape of the mouth and being used for terms related to words and speech, and may mean something like "commander of words" or "commander through words".\\

2 - the \textit{niwt} sign can also determine a place, a town or other settlement and the choice of the word city is to convey a modern equivalent to this title.\\

3 - the title of \textit{TAti} translated as "vizier" is a somewhat modern projection here, it could perhaps also be translated as "prime minister", or as a "second in command" to the king.\\

4 - \textit{Xprw} is closely related to the god Khepri, who symbolises the making of progress of the sun when it rises.\\

5 - \textit{wr} as a determinative seems often to be used with concepts associated with \textit{\indexed{isfet}}, as well as being a word on its own which is usually translated to mean "great" or "old".\\

6 - \textit{iw} is a particle with no direct translation in English.
